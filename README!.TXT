Instructions:

Install the dependencies (the bat file must be run after installing python)

Install the fonts (see "README.TXT" in fonts folder)

Install speakonia (see "README.TXT" in speakonia folder)

Run Project64, start mario 64, then you can start using SM64 Movie Maker and SM64 Eye Changer.

No additional setup required, everything is preconfigured except for video settings like resolution, aspect ratio, etc.

Enjoy!

NOTE: This only covers the mario 64 machinima side of things. You'll need to research about garry's mod yourself.
